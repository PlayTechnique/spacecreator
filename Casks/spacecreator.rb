  caveats <<~EOS
    SpaceCreator requires accessibility permissions to create spaces.

    After installation, you may need to:
    1. Open System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility
    2. Enable SpaceCreator in the list

    The app has been added to your login items and will start automatically.
